This repository is an exhibition of a feature request challenge. For context, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Why Does Web Accessbility Matter?
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.
