This repository is an exhibition of a feature request challenge. For context, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Why Does Web Accessbility Matter?
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

## How Did I Refactor the Codebase?
   *  Added alt tags on image elements to inform search engine crawlers in an effort to allow them to index images correctly. 
   *  Added nav tag to provide proper usability for navigation bar at the top of page.
   *  Added section and article tags to properly split the page and structure independent sections within main content.
   *  Added footer tag to provide a simple footer at the bottom of the page.
   *  Grouped CSS selectors as per scout rule.
